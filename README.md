# This is the offical repo for plugins on The Leaves classicube server.
How do I add them?
You add them by:
1. Using `/pcompile <plugin name>`,
2. Then using `/pload <plugin name>`.

## Current plugins

1. Angular Compass (`Compass`), it shows on your screen a compass.
2. Anti Clients* (`AntiClient`), prevents players with clients that are not using ClassiCube.

## Note

Plugins with a star after the names e.g Anti Clients*, means that the plugin is private.
